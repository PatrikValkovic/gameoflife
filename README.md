## Rules

* Each live cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
* Each live cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Each live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
* Each dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes populated.

Surface is stored in object - that mean that it is theoretically infinite.
